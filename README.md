# MooseSatchelMod

Change behaviour of Moose bag (satchel) - it will reduce scent and decay for meat, fish and guts.
If bag is equipped, it will scan player inventory and map above items up to 5kg bag capacity, changing it's values.
If bag is removed, it will unmap them and restore values.
If item (not bag) is added to inventory, it will see if there is space in bag and if so map/add it.
If item is removed from inventory, it will be unmap.
In inventory page, bagged item will have info in description, while bag will display how much scent it reduced.

Partially consuming food probably will not reduce size
If in doubt, re-equipp moose bag(s) so it will re-add all items.
(yes, mod was build to support mutiple bags, but base game does not)

Also, Guts are more smelly than meat per kg - while bag doesn't prioritise any item/group, manually dropping other ones and adding guts first is a good idea.

Scent value is from vanilla game and it's a arbiary number. [Fandom wiki have info on that](https://thelongdark.fandom.com/wiki/Scent)
